Problem Statement Title
Smart Water Pressure Management for Equitable Water Supply in Solapur
Description
Problem Statement Title: Smart Water Pressure Management for Equitable Water Supply in Solapur Background Solapur Municipal Corporation (SMC) provides drinking water to more than 10 lakh residents across multiple distribution zones.Despite continuous efforts, several challenges persist: Low water pressure in elevated or tail-end areas Uneven distribution across zones Irregular supply timings Significant water loss due to leakages, aging pipelines, and manual valve operations Lack of real-time data, causing delayed response and inefficient planning Since the existing system uses largely manual processes and lacks modern monitoring tools, SMC requires a smart, automated, and data-driven approach to ensure equitable water access for all citizens. Challenge Develop a technological solution that enables SMC to monitor, analyze, and maintain optimal water pressure across its distribution network to ensure fair, transparent, and efficient water supply. Your solution should aim to: Detect and analyze pressure variations in real-time Using IoT sensors, flow meters, or software-based analytics. Identify leakages, bursts, or unauthorized consumption Through anomaly detection or pattern analysis. Optimize valve and pump operations Using predictive models, scheduling algorithms, or automated controls. Ensure fair distribution across all zones Especially in high-altitude and rapidly growing localities. Provide a scalable, cost-effective system Compatible with SMC's existing water infrastructure. Expected Outcomes Participants should deliver: A smart water pressure monitoring dashboard Powered by IoT, sensors, GIS mapping, or AI-based analytics. Predictive analytics model To forecast pressure drops, peak demand, or potential leak points. User-friendly mobile/web interface For municipal engineers; citizen interface is optional but encouraged. Policy and operational recommendations For long-term smart water governance, automation, and sustainability. Evaluation Criteria Solutions will be assessed on: Innovation and technical feasibility Cost-effectiveness and ability to scale city-wide Ease of integration with existing SMC infrastructure Impact on equitable and sustainable water supply User experience and practical applicability
